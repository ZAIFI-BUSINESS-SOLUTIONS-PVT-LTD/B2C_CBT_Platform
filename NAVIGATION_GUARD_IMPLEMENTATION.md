# Navigation Guard Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive navigation protection for the test interface, preventing users from accidentally leaving during a test and from re-entering completed/quit test sessions.

## Problem Solved
1. **During Test**: Users could accidentally navigate away (back button, refresh, close tab) losing test progress
2. **After Test**: Users could navigate back to completed/quit test sessions, causing confusion and potential security issues

## Implementation Details

### 1. Active Test Protection (`test-interface.tsx`)

#### Navigation Blocking
- **Browser Back/Forward**: Uses `popstate` event listener with `history.pushState`
- **Tab Close/Refresh**: Uses `beforeunload` event listener
- **State Management**: `isNavigationBlocked` controls when protection is active

#### User Experience
- **Quit Dialog**: Shows confirmation when user tries to navigate away
- **Options**: "Continue Exam" (stays) or "Quit Exam" (marks incomplete)
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear warnings about consequences

### 2. Test Session Status Guard

#### Automatic Redirection
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (testData?.session) {
    const session = testData.session;
    
    // Completed test → Redirect to results
    if (session.is_completed === true) {
      navigate(`/results/${sessionId}`);
      return;
    }
    
    // Quit test (incomplete) → Redirect to dashboard
    if (session.endTime && session.is_completed === false) {
      navigate('/dashboard');
      return;
    }
  }
}, [testData, sessionId, navigate]);
```

### 3. Backend API Enhancement

#### Quit Endpoint (`/api/test-sessions/:id/quit/`)
- Marks test as incomplete (`is_completed = false`)
- Sets end time for proper tracking
- Returns appropriate status response

### 4. Data Flow

#### Test Session States
1. **Active**: `is_completed = false`, `endTime = null`
2. **Completed**: `is_completed = true`, `endTime = set`
3. **Quit (Incomplete)**: `is_completed = false`, `endTime = set`

#### Navigation Logic
```
User tries to access test session:
├── Session is completed? → Redirect to /results/:id
├── Session has endTime but not completed? → Redirect to /dashboard
└── Session is active? → Allow access + Enable navigation guard
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. Prevents Test Session Replay
- Users cannot re-enter completed tests
- Prevents tampering with submitted results
- Maintains test integrity

### 2. Consistent User Experience
- Clear feedback on test status
- Prevents confusion from accessing stale sessions
- Proper flow: Test → Results/Dashboard

### 3. Data Integrity
- Test sessions have definitive end states
- Proper tracking of completion vs. abandonment
- Analytics remain accurate

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Normal Test Completion
1. User takes test
2. User submits test → `is_completed = true`, navigation enabled
3. Redirects to results page
4. If user presses back → Automatically redirected to results (no test access)

### Scenario 2: User Quits Test
1. User takes test
2. User tries to navigate away → Quit dialog appears
3. User selects "Quit Exam" → `is_completed = false`, `endTime = set`
4. Redirects to dashboard
5. If user presses back → Automatically redirected to dashboard (no test access)

### Scenario 3: Accidental Navigation During Test
1. User takes test
2. User accidentally presses back → Quit dialog appears
3. User selects "Continue Exam" → Dialog closes, test continues
4. No data loss, seamless experience

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- ✅ Enhanced `TestInterface` component with navigation guards
- ✅ Added quit confirmation dialog
- ✅ Added test session status validation
- ✅ Updated TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Proper state management for navigation blocking

### Backend Changes
- ✅ Added `/quit/` endpoint in `TestSessionViewSet`
- ✅ Enhanced test session status tracking
- ✅ Proper API responses for different states

### Database Schema
- ✅ Existing fields sufficient (`is_completed`, `end_time`)
- ✅ No migrations required
- ✅ Backward compatible

## Testing Scenarios

### During Test
- [x] Browser back button → Shows quit dialog
- [x] Browser forward button → Shows quit dialog
- [x] Tab close (Ctrl+W) → Browser warning
- [x] Page refresh (F5) → Browser warning
- [x] Normal submission → Navigation allowed

### After Test Completion
- [x] Back to test URL → Auto-redirect to results
- [x] Direct test URL access → Auto-redirect to results
- [x] Results page accessible → ✅

### After Test Quit
- [x] Back to test URL → Auto-redirect to dashboard
- [x] Direct test URL access → Auto-redirect to dashboard
- [x] Dashboard accessible → ✅

## Error Handling

### Network Issues
- Graceful degradation if API calls fail
- User feedback through toast notifications
- Maintains navigation protection during failures

### Edge Cases
- Session not found → Proper error handling
- Invalid session ID → 404 response
- Concurrent access → Proper locking

## Performance Considerations

### Minimal Overhead
- Event listeners only active during test
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount
- Efficient query invalidation

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of timeouts
- Event listener removal
- State reset on navigation

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Features
- ✅ `beforeunload` event (all modern browsers)
- ✅ `popstate` event (all modern browsers)
- ✅ `history.pushState` (all modern browsers)
- ✅ Modern JavaScript features

### Fallback Behavior
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Core functionality maintained
- User warnings still displayed

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly navigation guard system that matches industry standards for online testing platforms.
