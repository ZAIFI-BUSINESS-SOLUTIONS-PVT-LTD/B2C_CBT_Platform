# Speech-to-Text Feature Implementation

## Overview
The chatbot now includes a speech-to-text feature using the native Web Speech API. Users can click the microphone button to speak their questions instead of typing them.

## Features Implemented

### üé§ Mic Button
- **Location**: Next to the chat input box in both the "Where should we begin?" section and the regular chat input area
- **Visual States**:
  - Normal state: Mic icon with standard button styling
  - Recording state: Check (‚úì) icon with green background and pulsing ring animation
  - Disabled state: Grayed out when browser doesn't support speech recognition

### üó£Ô∏è Speech Recognition
- **Browser Support**: Uses `window.SpeechRecognition` or `window.webkitSpeechRecognition`
- **Real-time Transcription**: Text appears in the input box as you speak
- **Language Support**: Default is English (US), configurable for multiple languages
- **Manual Stop & Send**: Clicking the check icon stops recording and automatically sends the message

### üåê Language Configuration
- **Default Language**: English (US) - `en-US`
- **Supported Languages**: Includes Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and other Indian languages
- **Configurable**: Easy to change via `SPEECH_CONFIG.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`/client/src/pages/chatbot.tsx`** - Main chatbot component updated with speech functionality
2. **`/client/src/types/speech.d.ts`** - TypeScript definitions for Web Speech API
3. **`/client/src/config/speech.ts`** - Configuration for speech recognition settings

### Key Components

#### Speech State Management
```typescript
// Speech recognition states
const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const [speechSupported, setSpeechSupported] = useState(false);
const [recognitionLanguage, setRecognitionLanguage] = useState(SPEECH_CONFIG.DEFAULT_LANGUAGE);
```

#### Speech Recognition Setup
- Initializes `SpeechRecognition` with configured settings
- Handles real-time transcription with `onresult` event
- Manages error handling for various scenarios (no speech, permission denied, etc.)
- Provides comprehensive logging for debugging

#### UI Integration
- Mic button appears only when speech recognition is supported
- Visual feedback with green background and pulsing ring animation during recording
- Check icon indicates "stop and send" functionality
- Status indicators show when actively listening
- Graceful fallback when speech recognition is not available

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Start Voice Input**: Click the microphone button next to the text input
2. **Speak Your Question**: The button will turn green with a pulsing ring and show a check (‚úì) icon while listening
3. **Stop and Send**: Click the check (‚úì) icon to stop recording and automatically send the message
4. **Review Before Sending**: The transcribed text appears in real-time, so you can see what will be sent

### For Developers

#### Changing the Default Language
```typescript
// In /client/src/config/speech.ts
export const SPEECH_CONFIG = {
  DEFAULT_LANGUAGE: 'hi-IN', // Change to Hindi
  // ... other settings
};
```

#### Adding New Languages
```typescript
// Add to SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES array
{ code: 'es-ES', name: 'Spanish (Spain)' },
```

#### Customizing Recognition Settings
```typescript
// In /client/src/config/speech.ts
RECOGNITION_SETTINGS: {
  interimResults: true,    // Show partial results
  continuous: true,        // Keep listening until manually stopped
  maxAlternatives: 1,      // Number of alternative transcriptions
},
```

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- ‚úÖ **Chrome/Chromium**: Full support (recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Edge**: Full support
- ‚úÖ **Safari**: Limited support (may require user interaction)
- ‚ùå **Firefox**: No native support

### Fallback Behavior
- Mic button is hidden if speech recognition is not supported
- Console warnings provide debugging information
- Normal text input remains fully functional

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:

- **No Speech Detected**: Logged but doesn't interrupt user flow
- **Audio Capture Failed**: Indicates microphone permission issues
- **Permission Denied**: User needs to allow microphone access
- **Network Errors**: Handles connectivity issues gracefully
- **Unknown Errors**: General fallback with detailed logging

## Security Considerations

- **Browser-only Implementation**: No audio data sent to backend servers
- **Microphone Permissions**: Requires user consent for microphone access
- **Privacy**: All speech processing happens locally in the browser

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open the chatbot in a supported browser (Chrome recommended)
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Click the mic button and speak a test phrase
4. Verify text appears in the input box
5. Test stopping recording by clicking mic again
6. Verify the message can be sent normally

### Error Scenario Testing
1. Test in an unsupported browser (Firefox)
2. Deny microphone permissions
3. Test with no microphone connected
4. Test in a noisy environment

## Performance Notes

- **Minimal Impact**: Speech recognition only activates when button is clicked
- **Real-time Processing**: Transcription happens as you speak
- **Memory Management**: Properly cleans up recognition instances
- **No Backend Load**: All processing happens client-side

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Language Selector UI**: Dropdown to change recognition language
2. **Voice Commands**: Recognize commands like "send message" or "new chat"
3. **Confidence Scores**: Display transcription confidence levels
4. **Custom Vocabulary**: Add domain-specific terms for better accuracy
5. **Noise Cancellation**: Improve accuracy in noisy environments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Mic Button Not Appearing**
   - Check browser compatibility
   - Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for microphone access)

2. **Permission Denied Errors**
   - User needs to explicitly allow microphone access
   - Check browser settings for microphone permissions

3. **Poor Transcription Accuracy**
   - Ensure quiet environment
   - Speak clearly and at normal pace
   - Check microphone quality

4. **Recording Doesn't Stop**
   - Click the mic button again to manually stop
   - Check console for error messages

### Debug Information
The implementation includes comprehensive console logging with üé§ emoji prefix for easy identification of speech-related messages.
