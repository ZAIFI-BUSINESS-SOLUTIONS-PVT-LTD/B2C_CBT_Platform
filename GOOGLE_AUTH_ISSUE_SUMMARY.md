# Google Authentication Integration: Issue & Resolution Summary

## Implementation Overview
We integrated Google authentication into our Django (DRF) + React (Vite) NEET platform using the following approach:

- **Frontend:**
  - Used Google Identity Services for both One Tap and OAuth popup flows.
  - On successful sign-in, either an `id_token` (One Tap) or an authorization `code` (popup) is sent to the backend.
  - The React AuthContext manages tokens and student state.

- **Backend:**
  - Django REST endpoint `/api/auth/google/` accepts either an `idToken` (for One Tap) or an OAuth `code` (for popup flow).
  - For `idToken`, the backend verifies the JWT with Google and issues platform tokens.
  - For `code`, the backend exchanges it for tokens with Google, verifies the `id_token`, and issues platform tokens.
  - Student profiles are created or updated as needed.

## Issue Faced

- After a successful Google OAuth popup flow, the frontend received tokens and student info from the backend.
- However, the frontend then called `loginWithGoogle(data.id_token)`, which made a redundant POST request with an empty or invalid payload (since `id_token` was not present in the response).
- This resulted in a 400 Bad Request error from the backend and prevented seamless login.

## Resolution

- We updated the frontend logic so that after a successful code exchange (popup flow), the tokens and student info returned by the backend are used directly to update the AuthContext (set tokens, set student, set authenticated state).
- The extra call to `loginWithGoogle` was removed for the popup flow.
- Now, One Tap (id_token) and popup (code) flows both work seamlessly, and student profiles are created/logged in as expected.

## Key Takeaway
Always use the backend's response directly after a successful OAuth code exchange. Avoid redundant authentication calls that may send incomplete or invalid data.
